Here’s an overall idea for your Pharmacy Sales Prediction System project, formatted for your GitHub description:

📊 Pharmacy Sales Prediction System

🔥 Overview

This project is a machine learning-based forecasting system designed to predict weekly pharmacy sales based on historical sales data. It allows users to input a category (e.g., medicine type) and a date, returning the closest valid forecasted sales value.

🎯 Key Features

Historical Data Processing: Cleans and processes past pharmacy sales records.
Date Modification: Adjusts dataset dates (e.g., shifting years to 2019).
Sales Forecasting: Predicts future sales using machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, or XGBoost).
User Input Handling: Accepts user-specified category and date to return the most relevant prediction.
Visualization: Displays trends using matplotlib/seaborn for better insights.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
Machine Learning (Time Series Models: ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, etc.)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Flask/FastAPI (Optional, for API deployment)

🚀 How It Works

Preprocess Data – Load, clean, and modify date formats if necessary.
Train Model – Use historical sales data to train a predictive model.
User Input – Accept a category and a date as input.
Find Closest Valid Prediction – Return forecasted sales for the nearest valid date.
Visualize & Interpret Results – Show trends and patterns.

📌 Future Improvements

Support for multiple pharmacies and seasonal trends.
Web-based interactive UI for easy predictions.
Integration with real-time data sources for live forecasting.
Background of the problem

Pharmacists and drug sellers in Sri Lanka face many challenges due to issues likeweather, importing difficulties, andeconomic problems. This often leads to a shortage of medicines when people need them most. To help, we want to create a data science system that predicts these issues, so sellers can better prepare and reduce shortage.


Frontend development - HTML,CSS and Flask render templates
Backend development - Python,Pandas,Matplotlib,adfuller,Flask
Data collection and pre-processing

We gathered data from two pharmacies in particular area.

Then categorize those data according to ATC classification system managed by WHO (e.g., acetaminophen belongs to ATC code -N02BE01).



We will process the dataset by handling null values, addressing missing data, and managing outliers accordingly.

Model Implementation

Reason for use time series forecasting: 1.SARIMA handles seasonality 2.Captures trends and seasonality in sales 3.Provides reliable forecast for higher accuracy
We split entire dataset into Train and Test data.
Testing and Evaluation


Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test used to check if the sales data was stationary (required for time-series forecasting).ADF test showed non-stationary data (p-value > 0.05).
Applied differencing to make the data stationary.
Chosen for its ability to handle seasonal patterns in the sales data.
Compared predicted vs. actual test sale data, showing reliable and accurate forecasts for drug categories.
The model helped pharmacists manage inventories, reducing shortages and wastage.
